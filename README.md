# git_automation_scripts

In this repository is a simple python script to automate my 5 most common git processes, running this script within a project simply would just make the process easier for me when it comes to my most common commands.
There are processes in Git that require more intuition like branching, merging and comparing and those processes are not within this script.

Another reason for this script is that I have worked with teams that have little to no understanding of Git, and this script is here to help them with the very basic or most common Git commands

Script requirements:
- Python 
- Git
